# Self Avoiding Walk

Inspired initially by Dan Shiffman's
Coding Challenge 162: Self-Avoiding Walk

My latest attempt is the file saw4.py

I'm using tkinter to plot the progress but, 
it has a tedious setup and I can't seem to 
find a simple way to make it a plug-in.  In 
the coding train videos, Dan uses JavaScript 
with P5 and it looks ideal for this sort of 
thing.  I noticed that there is a p5 for 
python and tried **pip install p5**.  It took 
ages to install all its dependencies and 
their most basic example failed to run due 
to missing libraries.  So, I dumped it 
without trying any further.

If you have a suggesion for a simple canvas for
quick code plotting, please let me know.
